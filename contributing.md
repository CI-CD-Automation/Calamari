If you have an issue or feature request for [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com), please talk to us via our [support channels](https://octopus.com/support) rather than submitting a PR or issue against this repository. 

If you want to modify this code for your own purposes, great!  Though we recommend you maintain your own fork of this repository, as we will evolve it to meet the needs of Octopus Deploy, which may involve breaking changes.  We are unlikely to merge changes which are not required for Octopus.
